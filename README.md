# Document Indexing
This repo explores important concepts in Information Retrieval via the creation of an Inverted Index on a corpus containing the scripts for various episodes of The Simpsons. This index supports keyword search for prevalent terms in the corpus, allowing the user to find episodes where specific words and phrases are mentioned.

## Repo Structure
- Simpsons/ -> Corpus data. All data is scraped from Wikipedia
- inverted_index.ipynb -> Jupyter notebook containing the relevant code and explanations
